# Park-Management
A CRUD app built on the MERN stack to manage basic logistics of a municipality's parks.

For a school project, we were tasked with creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. With my partner [Matt Rost](https://github.com/mattrost/), we chose to set up an application using the MERN stack (MySQL, Express, React, Node.js)

The site is not currently deployed, but for a demo, please watch the video below:
